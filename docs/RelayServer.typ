== Overview

Relay is an open-source communication application focused on self-hosting. The project began in 2024, when one of the developers, Spooketti, created the first version of Relay as a web application in high school. In response to modern chat data breaches and privacy concerns, the Relay project was reinstated in 2026 with a focus on decentralized servers. The modern centralized server design focuses on all users connecting to one server and sharing all their data with one third party that now controls all user data. These servers then rely on the promise of data protection for upwards of millions of users. Decentralized servers mean that all data, such as accounts and messages, can only exist on a per-server basis. 


The modern Relay client now operates in a terminal environment and is written in Go. This is documentation of the server, written in Go. It will cover [TBD]
